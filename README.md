### APK Explorer & Editor, an open-source tool to explore the contents of an installed APK, is strictly made with an aim to inspect an installed APK file.

## Features
AEE currently supports the following tasks
* Explore an installed application or APK file picked from the device storage and navigate through its contents.
* Save/export individual resource files such as icon, fonts, graphics, binary XML files, etc to device storage.
* Export and easily manage (install, share etc.) APK's/Split APK's into device storage.
* Includes a feature-rich APK/Split APK/App bundle installer (easily pick and install files from device storage)
* Edit text/binary XML files using an in-built text editor (still, a bit buggy especially when working with big APK's).
* Delete or replaces resources.
* Assemble modified smali files into new classes (.dex).
* Create signed APK's/App Bundles after the above-mentioned processes.
* Resign APK's/bundles with AEE custom key.
* A lot more...
